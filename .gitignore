# IMPORTANT: If these files are very large (e.g., > 50-100 MB),
# you might want to uncomment these lines and manage them via Git LFS
# or provide download instructions in your README.md.
# If they are small enough, keep them commented out (or remove these lines)
# so they are included in your Git repository.
